This error can occur if you have defined a class, struct, or enum twice within the same scope in your \u0060maze.h\u0060 file.\n\nHere\u0027s a simple example of how this error might occur:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cpp\nclass Maze {\n    // class definition\n};\n\nclass Maze {\n    // another class definition\n};\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nIn the above example, the \u0060Maze\u0060 class is defined twice, which would cause a C2011 error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should check your \u0060maze.h\u0060 file for any duplicate class, struct, or enum definitions and remove or rename the duplicates. If the type is defined in another included header file, you might need to use include guards or \u0060#pragma once\u0060 to prevent multiple inclusions.\n\nRemember, it\u0027s good practice to ensure that each type has a unique name and is defined only once in your code to avoid such errors.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["What are include guards in C\u002B\u002B?","Can you explain more about \u0060#pragma once\u0060?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"Explain","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}
